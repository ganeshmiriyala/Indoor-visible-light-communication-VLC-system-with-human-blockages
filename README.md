Performance Analysis of Indoor Communication System Using Off-the-Shelf LEDs With Human Blockages

**ABSTRACT**

In this report we analyze the downlink performance of an indoor visible light communication(VLC) system with human blockages with the use of geometry model-based approach. The system performance is analyzed for a regular placement of light emitting diodes(LEDs) in the circular configuration. The analysis is divided into two parts. In the first part we analyze the performance of LEDs placement configuration with multiple radii and with 5x5x5 & 10x10x5 room dimensions further we compared it with 4 and 8 LEDs configuration with the predefined power constraint. Then we extend it with the static human blockages and conclude that at the higher density of human blockages gives low total average received power and the 4-LEDs configuration outperformed the 8-LED configuration. So the proposed analysis will be useful for designing a VLC based indoor communication system where designers can switch between these two configurations depending on the number of blockages and room dimension.
